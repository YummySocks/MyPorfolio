            My name is Patrick Sutcliffe and I really enjoy coding and making new things. Started coding back when I was playing around with minecraft and then took a certification course on the full MERN stack. I am always excited to learn new things and to expand my knowledge and experience.

            Most recently I have learned how to use AWS and Java. I am enjoying both of those immensely. In my free time I like to play Magic the Gathering or play some of my many video games like Destiny 2 or Elden Ring.
